1,What is Artificial Intelligence?,Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn.,AI
2,What is Machine Learning?,Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.,AI/ML
3,Supervised Learning,Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data to make predictions.,ML
4,Unsupervised Learning,Unsupervised learning trains models on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings.,ML
5,Reinforcement Learning,Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors.,ML
6,What are Neural Networks?,"Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain, used for pattern recognition and learning.",ML/Deep Learning
7,Deep Learning,Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns.,Deep Learning
8,Natural Language Processing,NLP is a branch of AI focused on understanding and generating human language by machines.,NLP
9,Tokenization,"Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens, like words or subwords.",NLP
10,Embeddings,Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text or items that capture semantic meaning.,NLP/Vector
11,Vector Search,Vector search retrieves information by comparing embeddings to find the most similar items.,RAG
12,Retrieval-Augmented Generation,RAG combines vector search with generative models to answer queries using retrieved context.,RAG
13,Transformers,Transformers are neural network architectures that use attention mechanisms for sequence modeling.,Deep Learning/NLP
14,Attention Mechanism,Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of input sequences when making predictions.,Deep Learning/NLP
15,BERT,BERT is a transformer-based model for NLP that understands the context of words in a sentence.,NLP
16,GPT,GPT is a generative transformer model that can generate human-like text based on input prompts.,NLP
17,Fine-tuning,Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks by training on task-specific data.,ML/NLP
18,Vector Database,Vector databases store embeddings and enable fast similarity search for RAG applications.,RAG
19,Cosine Similarity,Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors based on the angle between them.,RAG/Vector
